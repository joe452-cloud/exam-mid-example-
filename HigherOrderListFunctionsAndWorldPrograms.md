# Falling Balloons (with higher-order list functions)

Write a variant of the Falling Balloons exercise in Workshop 3A [here](../ws3a/WorldProgramsAndListsExercises.md) that uses higher-order list functions.

# Falling Balloons (additional features)

Add the following functionality to the world program written in the previous exercise.
You should use higher-order list functions all the way through.

* Pressing keys `"R"`, `"G"`, `"B"`, `"M"`, or, `"L"` removes all `RED`, `GREEN`, `BLUE`, `MAGENTA`, or `BLACK` marbles, respectively
* Pressing arrow keys moves all marbles 5 pixels in the corresponding direction
* Right-clicking a marble changes itâ€™s colour to a different random colour
